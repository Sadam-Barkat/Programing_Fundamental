# Operator Precedence and Associativity in C++

This repository contains an assignment that explores **operator precedence** and **associativity** in C++. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing correct and efficient expressions in C++ programming.

## Overview

In C++, operators have specific rules that determine the order in which they are evaluated in expressions. These rules are known as **operator precedence** and **associativity**.

- **Operator Precedence**: Determines the priority of operators in expressions, defining the order in which they are applied.
- **Associativity**: Defines the direction (left-to-right or right-to-left) in which operators of the same precedence level are evaluated.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

## Examples

This assignment includes examples demonstrating how C++ evaluates expressions with different operators and how precedence and associativity affect the result.
