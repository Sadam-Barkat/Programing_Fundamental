## Introduction
This repository provides an introduction to basic C++ programming concepts. It's designed for beginners who want to build a solid foundation in programming with C++.

## Getting Started
To run the C++ programs, you need a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang. You can write code in any text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.

## Topics Covered

### Hello World
- Write and understand your first C++ program: `"Hello, World!"`

### Basic Syntax
- Learn the structure of a simple C++ program, including `main()` function and comments.

### Variables and Data Types
- Understand variables and data types like `int`, `float`, `char`, and `double`.

### Operators
- Explore operators in C++: arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.

### Control Structures
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`) to control program flow.

### Functions
- Create reusable code with functions, understand function declaration, definition, and parameters.

### Arrays
- Work with arrays to store multiple values in a single variable.
