# C++ Programming Fundamentals - Lab Work

This repository contains lab exercises designed to reinforce fundamental C++ programming concepts. Each lab task addresses a specific topic, helping you build practical skills and deepen your understanding of C++ basics.

## Overview

The lab exercises cover essential C++ topics such as basic input/output, control structures, operators, functions, and arrays. Each lab file includes example code and challenges to practice key concepts, allowing you to apply theoretical knowledge in a hands-on environment.

## Topics Covered in Lab Work

1. **Basic Input/Output**: Using `cin` and `cout` to read from and write to the console.
2. **Variables and Data Types**: Declaring variables, data type usage, and type conversions.
3. **Control Structures**: Implementing conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
4. **Operators**: Using arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.
5. **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks with functions, understanding parameters and return values.
6. **Arrays**: Storing multiple values in arrays and performing basic operations.
7. **Operator Precedence and Associativity**: Analyzing expressions with multiple operators to understand evaluation order.

## Lab Structure

Each lab exercise is organized into separate `.cpp` files for easy navigation and focused learning.
